# Appendix A: Marketing and Launch Strategy

*How to build the Taka community from zero and scale it.*

---

## Starting Position

- **Rules:** Locked
- **Online MVP:** Built, not yet publicly launched
- **Physical boards:** 500–1,000 Founders Edition, ~90-day production lead time
- **Existing community:** Near zero
- **Budget:** Lean (creator-driven, not paid-ads-driven)

---

## Strategic Principle: Community First, Products Second

The primary growth engine is the online competitive community — not board sales, not retail distribution, not paid ads. Physical boards are a prestige artifact and community catalyst. Everything in this plan serves one goal: **build a repeat-play online community and prove engagement.**

The logic: a competitive multiplayer game needs liquidity (enough players online at the same time to match quickly). Without liquidity, early users hit empty queues and churn. The entire marketing strategy is designed to manufacture density first, then scale.

---

## Phase 1: Create the Core (Weeks 1–4)

### Objective

Get the first 100–300 users playing regularly in scheduled windows. This is not about total signups — it is about concurrent players during fixed events.

### 1.1 Set Two Fixed Weekly Play Windows

Pick two recurring times and commit to them for at least 8–12 weeks.

**Example:**
- Wednesday 8–10pm ET (NA prime time)
- Saturday 1–3pm ET (EU-friendly / daytime NA)

These are "TAKA Night." All recruitment messaging points to these windows. Outside these hours, accept that concurrency may be thin — bots can backfill.

**Why this matters:** New multiplayer games die when early users find empty lobbies. Fixed windows concentrate players so the game feels alive.

### 1.2 Seed Cohorts, Not Individuals

Recruiting random individuals produces low-density, high-churn signups. Recruit groups instead.

| Cohort Source | Target Size | Approach |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Marshall men's soccer | 15–30 | Direct access; anchor cohort |
| Marshall women's soccer | 15–30 | Direct access; second anchor |
| 2–3 other college teams | 15–25 each | Friends-of-friends, coaches |
| 1–2 board game clubs | 10–20 each | Local clubs, online groups |
| 1 academy/youth group | 15–25 | Coach outreach |

**Offer that converts:** "We'll set up a private ladder for your group. Weekly match night. Top player gets featured on the leaderboard."

You are not asking them to "try a beta." You are inviting them to a competition.

### 1.3 Launch Status System

Early adopters need identity and recognition. Status is more powerful than prizes at this stage.

| Status | How to Earn |
|--------|-------------|
| **Founding Player** | Play 15 ranked matches in Season 0 |
| **Verified Player** | Marshall/D1 players (your network) |
| **Pro Status** | D1 athletes, exceptional players you know personally |
| **Club Captain** | Cohort organizers who bring a team |

These statuses should be visible on profiles and leaderboards.

### 1.4 Run Season 0

A 4-week "Season 0" with a hard end date creates urgency and structure.

- Visible leaderboard
- Weekly tournament within each TAKA Night
- End-of-season recognition (badges, profile cosmetics)
- Weekly highlights post (leaderboard screenshot + notable matches)

### 1.5 Bots for Backfill

Bots solve the empty-queue problem without creating false engagement metrics.

- Use bots to guarantee instant matches outside peak hours
- Use bots in onboarding (first 1–2 placement games)
- Label bots clearly
- Keep bots out of ranked or in a separate "training" queue
- Vary bot styles (pressing, low block, possession) for training value

**Bots reduce friction. They do not create community.**

### Phase 1 Targets (by end of Week 4)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Total users | 300–1,000 |
| Concurrent during TAKA Night | 50–150 |
| Matches per active user per week | 3+ |
| Cohorts onboarded | 6–10 |
| Weekly tournament participation | Growing each week |

---

## Phase 2: Scale Acquisition (Weeks 5–10)

### Objective

Find repeatable channels that produce engaged users. Grow WAU steadily.

### 2.1 Creator Seeding (Primary Scale Lever)

Creators are the cheapest scalable acquisition channel for competitive games — if you systemize it.

**Who to target:**

- Football tactics creators (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels) — 5k–100k followers
- Board game / strategy game reviewers
- Chess/strategy creators curious about sport-as-mindgame
- Youth soccer training content creators

**Scale:** Start with 20–30 creators in Weeks 5–6. Expand to 50–100 by Week 10. Do not chase large influencers yet — volume of small/mid creators producing repeatable content beats one-off posts from big names.

**What you give each creator (turnkey kit):**

1. **One-sentence description** they can use verbatim: "Taka is a 15-minute competitive football tactics game — play ranked matches and climb the ladder."
2. **Beta access codes** for their audience (limited, creates urgency)
3. **Three repeatable content formats** (see below)
4. **Weekly event to point viewers to** (TAKA Night tournament)
5. **Permission and encouragement** to show replays and matches

**Three formats that tend to work:**

| Format | Description | Why It Works |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Puzzle Challenge** | "Find the best move in this position" | Quick, shareable, generates comments |
| **Beat the Inventor** | Creator (or audience member) tries to beat the game's creator at a scheduled time | Drama, aspiration, social proof |
| **Road to Elo** | Creator documents their climb up the ranked ladder over multiple episodes | Serialized content, shows depth |

**Operating rule:** Do not pursue one-off posts. Prioritize creators willing to do weekly series. Five creators posting weekly beats fifty creators posting once.

**Measurement:** Track signups per creator code, activation rate (first match completed), and D7 retention by creator cohort. Double down on creators whose audiences actually retain.

### 2.2 Academy and College Cohort Expansion

Expand from Marshall to additional institutional cohorts.

**Target: 15–20 academy/team cohorts by Week 10.**

| Cohort Type | Outreach Method | Offer |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| College teams (men's/women's) | Coach DMs, player networks | Inter-team league, weekly ladder night |
| Youth academies | Coach outreach, club contacts | "Tactical training game" positioning, private leaderboard |
| Board game clubs | Discord outreach, local groups | Tournament entry, club ladder |
| Chess clubs | Cross-promote as "new competitive mind sport" | Season 0 invitational, strategy angle |

### 2.3 Strategy Game Community Outreach

Target communities where competitive ladder games are already valued.

- Chess Discords and forums (not as a "chess alternative" — as a "new mind sport")
- Competitive tabletop Discords (board game geek, heavy strategy communities)
- TCG communities (they understand meta, ladder, and competitive formats)
- Football tactics subreddits and Discords

**Post format that converts:** Don't post "try my game." Post about a specific upcoming event: "We're running a ranked tournament Wednesday 8pm ET — 50 slots, invite-only beta access." Scarcity and specificity beat generic pitches.

### 2.4 Referral System

Build a simple invite loop into the product.

| Action | Reward |
|--------|--------|
| Invite 3 friends who play a match | Unlock a cosmetic or tournament entry |
| Invite 10 friends | "Founder" tag on profile |
| Invite 25 friends | Early access to Founders Board reservation |

**Rewards should be status, not discounts.** Discounts attract low-intent users. Status attracts people who want to be part of something.

### 2.5 Content Loops (Retention and Acquisition)

Content that serves both retention (keeps current users engaged) and acquisition (attracts new users when shared).

| Content | Cadence | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Puzzle of the Day/Week** | Daily or 3x/week | Quick engagement; shareable on socials |
| **Opening of the Week** | Weekly | Builds meta culture; educational |
| **Match of the Week** | Weekly | Highlights tournament drama; shows depth |
| **Leaderboard Update** | Weekly | Status recognition; competitive motivation |
| **Creator Highlights** | Weekly | Cross-promotes creators; shows community |

### Phase 2 Targets (by end of Week 10)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Total users | 1,500–7,000 |
| WAU | 500–2,500 |
| Tournament participation | 10–20% of WAU |
| Active creators posting | 20–50 |
| Cohorts onboarded | 15–20 |
| At least 1 repeatable channel identified | Yes |

---

## Phase 3: Public Launch Moment (Weeks 11–14)

### Objective

Make Taka look and feel like a real competitive ecosystem. Convert the strongest community members into Founders Board customers. Produce the investor proof pack.

### 3.1 Season 1 Launch

Season 1 is the "official" public season. It should feel like an event.

- Public announcement with clear start/end dates
- Rewards for participation (badges, cosmetics, leaderboard recognition)
- Scheduled weekly tournaments with results posted
- Creator collabs timed around Season 1 launch and key dates

### 3.2 Marshall Showcase Tournament

A physical + online tournament hosted at or through Marshall University.

- On-campus event with media coverage (school newspaper, athletics media, local press)
- Streamed matches and commentary
- Produces content: photos, video clips, leaderboard results
- Creates a legitimacy anchor: "played at a Division I university"

### 3.3 Beat the Inventor Challenge

A recurring, scheduled event where anyone can try to beat the game's creator (you) in ranked play.

- Fixed weekly time slot (e.g., Thursdays 9pm ET)
- Public leaderboard of anyone who has beaten the inventor
- Badge/status for winners
- Creates drama, social proof, and a reason to show up

### 3.4 Founders Board Offer

Boards arrive around this time (~90 days from production order). Offer them to the community — not as a sales push, but as a status artifact.

**Who gets first access:**
- Top ladder players
- Tournament regulars
- Club captains and community builders
- Active creators

**Framing:** "500 numbered Founders Edition boards. Reserved for the community first." Scarcity and earned access, not cold sales.

### 3.5 Investor Proof Pack

By Day 90, compile the following evidence:

| Category | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| **Activation** | First-match completion rate |
| **Retention** | D7/D30 cohort curves (even if early) |
| **Engagement** | WAU, matches per WAU per week |
| **Competition** | Tournament participation rate, season completion rate |
| **Virality** | Invites sent per active user, referral conversion |
| **Channels** | Which acquisition sources produce engaged users |
| **Monetization intent** | Founders Board conversion rate from engaged users |

**Investor narrative:** "We built a competitive community with weekly tournaments and rising engagement before shipping physical inventory. Creators drive efficient acquisition. Physical products monetize our most engaged users."

### Phase 3 Targets (by Day 90)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Total users | 2,000–10,000 |
| WAU | 500–3,000 |
| Stable retention trend | D7 improving by cohort |
| Tournament attendance | Consistent weekly participation |
| Founders Board conversion (engaged users) | Meaningful conversion rate |
| Clear proof pack assembled | Yes |

## Acquisition Channel Summary

Ranked by expected impact for Taka's current stage:

| Priority | Channel | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| 1 | **Cohort imports** (teams, academies, clubs) | Highest retention; creates density immediately |
| 2 | **Micro-creators** (repeatable weekly formats) | Scalable; produces engaged cohorts if systematized |
| 3 | **Competitive communities** (chess/strategy/TCG forums) | High-intent users who value ladders and meta |
| 4 | **Referral system** (status-based rewards) | Multiplies existing engaged users |
| 5 | **IRL events** (TAKA Nights, campus pop-ups) | Creates local nodes that feed the online ladder |
| 6 | **Football tactics communities** (Reddit, Discord, Twitter) | Large audience but lower immediate conversion |
| 7 | **School/academy programs** (institutional adoption) | Slow but steady distribution |
| 8 | **Paid acquisition** (retargeting only, event-based ads) | Only after organic channels are proven; test cheaply |

---

## What NOT to Do Early

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Broad paid advertising | Expensive, attracts low-intent users, burns budget before you know what converts |
| Retail conversations | Until you have sell-through data and community proof |
| Licensing negotiations | Licensing is expensive and distracting before consumer PMF |
| "All ages" messaging | Dilutes; win a wedge audience first |
| Building cards/stadiums/modes | Scope creep; these are Phase 3+ |
| Chasing large influencers | One-off posts from big names produce spikes, not habits; systematic small creators are better |

---

## Claims to Make vs. Claims to Earn

| Say Now | Earn Later |
|---------|------------|
| "A competitive tactics game for football" | "The chess of football" |
| "Accessible entry, deep mastery" | "Marketed to all ages" |
| "Building toward a competitive ecosystem" | "Global mind sport" |
| "We'll pilot partnerships once the core is proven" | "Partnered with clubs" |
| "Creator-driven community" | "Content ecosystem" |

Credibility comes from evidence, not aspiration. Let the community and metrics earn the bigger claims over time.

---

## Decision Points to Lock Now

| Decision | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Founders run size | 500 (cleaner scarcity, higher sell-through probability); if strong distribution, 1,000 in two batches |
| Weekly event times | Pick two and commit for 12 weeks minimum |
| Community platform | Discord (default for gaming communities) |
| First cohort | Marshall men's + women's soccer |
| First creator batch | 20–30 micro-creators in Weeks 5–6 |

---

## Summary

The marketing strategy is: **manufacture density through cohorts and scheduled events → scale through creators and referrals → convert into a visible competitive ecosystem → offer physical products to the most engaged members.**

Board sales, club partnerships, licensing, and ecosystem expansion all follow from a proven, active, retained online community. The community is the asset. Everything else is built on top of it.
