"""
Elimination Logic - The Core Attacking Metric

A defender is eliminated if:
1. The ball is past them (positionally, toward the attacking goal)
2. They cannot reach an effective intervention point before the attacker
   can reach a more dangerous outcome (goal approach or shot)

Elimination is BINARY at the moment of evaluation. A defender is either
eliminated or not. There is no partial elimination.

Key insight: A defender who is goal-side but functionally irrelevant
(cannot intervene in time) is still eliminated.
