# Football Decision Engine - Technical Plan

## Vision

Build a system that answers: **"Given this situation, what has historically worked best?"**

Using tracking data and event data, analyze what attacking actions succeeded against specific defensive setups. When presented with a game situation, find the most similar historical situations and identify which actions led to success.

---

## Core Approach

### What We're Building

A **similarity-based retrieval system** that:
1. Encodes game situations as continuous feature vectors (not discrete categories)
2. Uses similarity algorithms to find matching historical situations
3. Analyzes what actions worked in those similar situations
4. Returns actionable insights to coaches

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | What We Chose | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Situation matching | Similarity algorithm on continuous features | Hard categories (zones, formation labels) lose nuance and create arbitrary boundaries |
| Defensive encoding | Behavioral features measured from tracking | Formation labels are imprecise - "4-4-2" means many different things |
| Ball position | Continuous coordinates | Zone boundaries are arbitrary - similarity handles "closeness" naturally |
| Skill imbalance | Address in Phase 3 | Build core system first, validate concept, then add complexity |

### Why This Approach

| Alternative | Why Not |
|-------------|---------|
| Pure RL/Simulation | No evidence of real-world tactical transfer (Google Football failed) |
| Board game abstraction | Unvalidated - no proof simplified rules capture real tactics |
| Formation labels | Too imprecise - same label describes very different defensive behaviors |
| Discrete zone categories | Arbitrary boundaries - play 1m apart gets different category |
| Exact position matching | No matches - football state space too large |

**This approach is grounded in:**
- Real tracking data (not simulation)
- Proven methodology (similar to TacticAI retrieval)
- Continuous features that capture actual defensive behavior
- Similarity algorithms that find meaningful matches without arbitrary categorization

- Outcomes (success/failure)
- Source: Wyscout, StatsBomb

### Derived: Context Data
- Score state
- Match time
- Team identities
- Competition level

## Situation Encoding

### Ball Position (Continuous)

**NOT discrete zones.** Instead, continuous features:

| Feature | Description | Unit |
|---------|-------------|------|
| `ball_x` | Horizontal position on pitch | Meters from left touchline |
| `ball_y` | Vertical position (depth) | Meters from own goal line |
| `ball_distance_to_goal` | Direct distance to opponent goal center | Meters |
| `ball_angle_to_goal` | Angle to goal from ball position | Degrees |

The similarity algorithm handles "closeness" - situations with ball at 35m and 36m will naturally be similar without needing to define zone boundaries.

### Defensive Features (Behavioral, Not Labels)

**NO formation labels.** Instead, measure actual defensive behavior from tracking data:

#### Core Features (Phase 1)

| Feature | Description | How to Measure |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `line_height` | How high/deep is the defensive line | Average Y-coordinate of back 4 (meters from own goal) |
| `compactness_vertical` | Vertical distance between defensive lines | Distance from deepest defender to highest midfielder (meters) |
| `compactness_horizontal` | Width of defensive shape | Distance between widest defenders (meters) |
| `press_intensity` | How aggressively they close down | Average closing speed when ball is received (m/s) |
| `pressure_on_ball` | Immediate pressure on ball carrier | Distance of nearest defender to ball (meters) |
| `players_behind_ball` | Defensive commitment | Count of defenders goal-side of ball |

#### Extended Features (Phase 2 - After Validation)

| Feature | Description | How to Measure |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `marking_style` | Man-oriented vs zonal | Correlation coefficient between defender movement and nearest attacker movement over possession |
| `shift_speed` | Defensive reaction time | Average time for defensive shape centroid to adjust after ball movement (seconds) |
| `recovery_tendency` | Counter-press vs drop | Average movement direction (toward/away from ball) in first 2s after possession loss |
| `defensive_width_ratio` | Shape relative to ball | Defensive width divided by distance from ball to goal |

### Attacking Features (Continuous)

| Feature | Description | How to Measure |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `attackers_ahead_of_ball` | Offensive presence | Count of attacking players with higher Y than ball |
| `attacking_width` | Spread of attack | Horizontal distance between widest attackers (meters) |
| `players_in_box` | Penalty area threat | Count of attackers in opponent's 18-yard box |
| `central_overload` | Middle congestion | Density of players in central channel |
| `space_ahead` | Room to progress | Nearest defender distance in direction of goal |

### Context Features

| Feature | Description | Values |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `score_differential` | Current advantage/disadvantage | Integer (..., -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, ...) |
| `match_time` | Minutes played | 0-90+ (continuous) |
| `possession_duration` | Time on ball | Seconds since possession started |

---

## Similarity Matching

### How It Works

1. **Encode each historical situation** as a feature vector containing all features above
2. **Normalize features** to same scale (z-score or min-max)
3. **For a query situation**, compute similarity to all historical situations
4. **Return top-N most similar** situations
5. **Analyze outcomes** of actions taken in those situations

### Distance/Similarity Metric

Weighted Euclidean distance across normalized features:

```
distance(A, B) = sqrt(
    w1 * (A.line_height - B.line_height)² +
    w2 * (A.compactness_vertical - B.compactness_vertical)² +
    w3 * (A.pressure_on_ball - B.pressure_on_ball)² +
    ...
)

similarity = 1 / (1 + distance)
```

**Initial weights:** Equal (1.0 for all features)

**Later:** Learn optimal weights by measuring which weighting best predicts similar outcomes for similar situations

### Why This Works Better Than Categories

| Categories (5x5 zones + formation labels) | Similarity on Continuous Features |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Ball at 34m and 36m might be different zones | Ball at 34m and 36m are naturally similar |
| "4-4-2" and "4-4-2 low block" same label | Actual line height distinguishes them |
| Man-to-man and zonal can look identical | Marking correlation feature captures difference |
| Fixed boundaries = arbitrary cutoffs | Similarity is continuous = no arbitrary lines |

---

## Success Metrics

### For Possessions

| Metric | Definition | Use Case |
|--------|------------|----------|
| `xT_gained` | Expected Threat added during possession | Primary success metric |
| `final_third_entry` | Did possession reach attacking third | Progression success |
| `shot_generated` | Did possession result in shot | Chance creation |
| `xG_of_shot` | If shot, what was its xG | Chance quality |

### For Evaluating the System

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| Outcome consistency | Do similar situations (high similarity score) have similar outcomes? |
| Coach relevance rating | Do coaches agree retrieved situations are tactically similar? |
| Recommendation accuracy | Do higher-rated actions actually succeed more often? |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Validate Core Concept)

**Goal:** Does similarity matching on behavioral features find meaningful patterns?

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Tracking data ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Core feature extraction (line height, compactness, pressure, ball position)
- [ ] Situation database with 1000+ possessions
- [ ] Similarity search implementation
- [ ] Basic outcome analysis ("what worked in similar situations")

**Validation Questions:**
- Do situations with high similarity scores have similar outcomes?
- Do coaches agree that retrieved situations are tactically relevant?
- Can we distinguish what works vs what doesn't in similar situations?

**Success Criteria:**
- Coaches rate retrieved situations as relevant >70% of the time
- Outcome variance within similar situations is lower than random baseline

---

### Phase 2: Refinement (Improve Accuracy)

**Goal:** Make similarity matching more accurate, add behavioral features

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Extended feature set (marking style, shift speed, recovery tendency)
- [ ] Learned feature weights (optimize for outcome prediction)
- [ ] Action-level analysis (not just possession-level)
- [ ] Confidence scores for recommendations
- [ ] Feature importance analysis (which features matter most)

**Validation Questions:**
- Do extended features improve outcome consistency within similar situations?
- Do learned weights outperform equal weights?
- Do coaches prefer recommendations with confidence scores?

---

### Phase 3: Skill Adjustment

**Goal:** Separate "this worked because it's good" from "good players executed it"

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Player physical metrics integration (speed, acceleration from tracking)
- [ ] Historical performance baselines per player (pass completion rates, etc.)
- [ ] Skill-adjusted success rates
- [ ] Within-team variation analysis (same team, different choices, what worked)

**Validation Questions:**
- Are patterns consistent when controlling for player/team quality?
- Do skill-adjusted recommendations differ from raw recommendations?
- Does skill adjustment improve prediction accuracy?

---

### Phase 4: Production

**Goal:** System ready for regular coaching staff use

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Fast query interface (<1 second response)
- [ ] Video clip retrieval for similar situations
- [ ] Pre-match report generation (opponent tendencies)
- [ ] Post-match report generation (decision analysis)
- [ ] API for integration with other tools

## What We're NOT Building (And Why)

| Not Building | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| Discrete zone categories | Similarity algorithm handles "closeness" better than arbitrary boundaries |
| Formation classifier/labels | Behavioral features are more accurate than labels |
| Full match simulation | Sim-to-real gap unsolved; no evidence of tactical transfer |
| Board game abstraction | Unvalidated hypothesis; not grounded in real data |
| Real-time in-match system | Validate offline system first; real-time adds complexity |
| Predictive model ("what will happen") | Starting with descriptive ("what has worked"); easier to validate |

---

## Open Questions (To Resolve Empirically)

1. **Feature weights:** Which features matter most for tactical similarity?
2. **Similarity threshold:** How similar is "similar enough" to draw conclusions?
3. **Sample size:** How many similar situations needed for reliable insight?
4. **Time window:** How much historical data is relevant? (Does 3-year-old data still apply?)
5. **Cross-league validity:** Do patterns transfer across leagues/competition levels?
6. **Optimal N:** How many similar situations should we retrieve? (10? 50? 100?)

---

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Chosen features don't capture what matters | Medium | High | Start with core features, validate with coaches, iterate based on feedback |
| Not enough similar situations in database | Medium | Medium | Cast wider similarity net; aggregate more data sources |
| Coaches don't trust/use system | Medium | High | Involve coaches early; show video evidence alongside recommendations |
| Tracking data too expensive | Low | High | Prove value with available data first, then justify expanded access |
| Skill imbalance skews early results | Medium | Medium | Be explicit about limitation; address properly in Phase 3 |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Secure tracking data access** - Required before anything else
2. **Build data ingestion pipeline** - Parse tracking + events, align by timestamp
3. **Implement core feature extraction** - Ball position, line height, compactness, pressure
4. **Create situation database** - Store feature vectors for historical possessions
5. **Build similarity search** - Nearest neighbor on normalized features
6. **Validate with coach** - Are retrieved situations tactically relevant?
