# TAKA — Business Plan

---

## Executive Summary

Taka is a competitive tactics board game that turns football decision-making into a fast, skill-based head-to-head contest — playable on a physical board and online. The game is designed to become the standardized "mind sport" of football: easy to learn, deep to master, and built for repeat competitive play.

The company starts as a board game (physical and online) marketed to all ages. Over time, it expands into a competitive ecosystem with ranked play, tournaments, team-building cards, club partnerships, and licensed collectibles. The long-term ambition is for Taka to become the chess of football — a universally recognized thinking game tied to the world's most popular sport.

This plan lays out the vision, market opportunity, product strategy, business model, and growth roadmap from launch through ecosystem scale.

## 1. The Game

### What Taka Is

Taka is a turn-based strategy game played on a 14×10 board with 22 pieces and two balls. Each team attacks with their own ball while simultaneously defending against the opponent's. Rules can be taught in 10 minutes. A match takes 15–25 minutes. Skill dominates outcomes — there is no dice, no card draws, no randomness.

### Core Design Principles

| Principle | How Taka Delivers |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Low barrier to entry** | Rules learned in 10 minutes; 16-step interactive tutorial online |
| **High skill ceiling** | Positional depth, facing management, passing chains, offside traps |
| **Feels like football** | Every mechanic maps to a real tactical decision (pressing angles, space creation, combination play) |
| **Competitive integrity** | No luck — outcomes determined by decision quality |
| **Fast matches** | 15–25 minutes per game; high replay rate |

### Why It Works

Football has 5 billion fans worldwide. There is no universally adopted thinking game that captures football decision-making the way chess captures abstract strategy. Existing football board games tend to be too simulation-heavy (niche hobbyists), too abstract (doesn't feel like football), or too luck-driven (not respected competitively). Taka sits in the gap: accessible strategy that feels authentically like football.

## 2. Vision

### The "Chess of Football"

Chess is not just a board game. It is a competitive ecosystem: rated play, tournaments, analysis culture, content creation, education, and a global community. Chess.com has surpassed 200 million members. The game is centuries old and still growing.

Taka aims to build the same kind of ecosystem around football tactics. The board game is the entry point. The destination is a global competitive platform with:

- A canonical ruleset recognized as the standard
- Online ranked ladder with seasons and tournaments
- An analysis culture (puzzles, openings, match review)
- Creator-friendly spectating and content formats
- Physical products and collectibles as brand extensions
- Club and league partnerships as accelerants

This is not guaranteed. The base rate for games achieving this kind of scale is low. But the structural conditions are favorable: football is global and internet-native, competitive mind sports scale via ladders and creators, and the board game market supports viable businesses even at modest scale.

### Multi-Year Trajectory

| Horizon | State |
|---------|-------|
| **Year 1** | Establish the standard — online ladder, seasons, tournaments, physical board launched |
| **Year 2** | Expand retention — clubs/guilds, puzzle pipeline, academy/school adoption |
| **Year 3** | Add ecosystem layers — team-building cards, UGC scenarios, premium physical drops |
| **Year 4+** | Scale globally — licensing, live events, media ecosystem |

---

## 3. Market Opportunity

### Market Context

Taka operates at the intersection of several large markets. These figures are drawn from multiple market research firms and should be treated as directional, not precise.

| Market | Estimated Size (2024–2025) | Growth Outlook |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Global board games | $12–16B | Growing to $20–39B by 2034 (estimates vary) |
| Sports trading cards | ~$11.5B | Continued growth through 2030s |
| Global video games | Hundreds of billions | Sustained growth |
| Licensed sports merchandise | $40B+ globally | Stable |
| Fantasy sports (North America) | Low tens of billions | Growing |

Taka does not need to capture a meaningful share of any single market to be a large business. Its ceiling is highest if it becomes a hybrid: tabletop brand + competitive digital platform + collectible economy.

### Competitive Landscape

**What Taka is NOT competing against directly:**

- EA Sports FC / football video games — Taka is a thinking/strategy identity, not a simulation
- Fantasy football platforms — different engagement model

**What Taka IS competing against:**

- Time and attention (other social/competitive games)
- Other tabletop games (for shelf space and play time)
- Chess (as the mental-sport benchmark)
- Novelty decay (the biggest risk for any new game)

**Historical comparisons:**

- **Subbuteo** demonstrated that football tabletop can be culturally resonant, but it is a dexterity game, not a mind sport, and has not achieved chess-like universality
- **Match Attax** proved that football trading cards can be a globally successful consumer product (Topps calls it the "world's best-selling sports trading card game")
- **Chess platforms** proved that a simple, competitive, no-luck game can scale to hundreds of millions of users online when paired with a ladder and content ecosystem

### Objective Assessment

The market is large enough to support a meaningful business at any level of success. The question is not market size — it is whether Taka can achieve standardization, network effects, and a retention flywheel. That is a product and community-building challenge, not a market-size problem.

## 4. Target Audience

### "For All Ages" Requires a Wedge First

Taka is designed to be played by anyone. But "marketed to all ages" is a positioning statement, not an acquisition strategy. The game must win a narrow, passionate audience first, then expand.

### Primary Wedge Audiences

| Audience | Why They're First |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Football tactics enthusiasts** | Players, coaches, academy members — they already think in Taka's language |
| **Competitive strategy gamers** | Chess, Go, TCG players — they value depth, fairness, and competitive ladders |
| **Creator audiences** | Football tactics and board game content consumers — they follow competitions |

### Expansion Audiences (post-PMF)

| Audience | Unlock Condition |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Families** | When onboarding is frictionless and the brand is recognizable |
| **Schools** | When "TAKA club" programs exist (after-school chess-club analog) |
| **Casual football fans** | When creator content and tournaments make the game visible |
| **Global mass market** | When standardization and network effects have taken hold |

## 5. Product Strategy

### Pillar A: The Game (Canonical Rules)

The ruleset is the foundational asset. It must be stable, balanced, and recognized as the standard. Variants can exist later, but the flagship format must be canonical.

Current status: **Rules locked.**

### Pillar B: The Online Platform

The online platform is where scale, retention, and investor-grade metrics are built.

**Core features (MVP):**

- Account creation and authentication (magic link)
- 16-step interactive tutorial
- Real-time multiplayer matches via matchmaking
- ELO rating system (beginner/intermediate/advanced tiers)
- Ranked ladder

**Required for community proof:**

- Seasons (fixed duration, end dates, rewards)
- Weekly tournaments (fixed schedule)
- Shareable match artifacts (replay links or recap cards)
- Referral/invite system
- Basic anti-cheat and moderation

Current status: **MVP built, not yet launched publicly.**

### Pillar C: Physical Board Game

The physical board is a prestige product, community catalyst, and brand entry point — not the primary growth engine.

| Component | Qty | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Game board (14×10 grid) | 1 | Premium pitch with markings |
| White pieces | 11 | Including goalie |
| Black pieces | 11 | Including goalie |
| Ball tokens | 2 | One per team |
| Direction indicators | 22 | Facing direction markers |
| Rule book | 1 | Complete reference |
| Quick-start guide | 1 | Learn in 5 minutes |

**Founders Edition:** 500–1,000 numbered, limited-run boards. Premium packaging. Offered to the most engaged community members as a status artifact.

Current status: **Production order imminent. ~90-day lead time.**

### Pillar D: Content and Culture

This is what makes the "chess of football" narrative real over time.

- **Puzzles** — daily/weekly tactical challenges from real games
- **Openings library** — documented patterns and common responses
- **Match review** — highlights and analysis of tournament games
- **Creator formats** — repeatable content series (puzzle challenges, road-to-elo, coach-vs-player)

### Pillar E: Community Infrastructure

- Clubs/guilds with internal ladders
- Regional and global leaderboards
- Ambassador/captain program
- Academy and school adoption kits

## 6. Business Model

Revenue is sequenced. Each line unlocks only after the prerequisite proof is established.

### Stage 1: Community Growth (Minimal Monetization)

| Revenue Line | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Founders board sales | Limited run, premium price, status artifact |
| Supporter tier | Optional subscription — cosmetics, analysis tools, tournament perks |

Purpose: validate willingness to pay and support early operations.

### Stage 2: Recurring Digital Revenue + Expansions

| Revenue Line | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Season passes | Cosmetic rewards, ranked perks, analysis features |
| Tournament entries | Paid competitive events with prizes |
| Club/academy packages | Private ladders, internal leaderboards, coaching features |
| Board expansions | Standard edition, accessories, premium variants |

Purpose: build sustainable recurring revenue from an engaged community.

### Stage 3: Ecosystem Monetization

| Revenue Line | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Team-building cards | Archetype-based player cards (unlicensed first, licensed later) |
| UGC marketplace | Community-created puzzles and scenarios |
| Premium physical drops | Stadium playsets, limited editions, collectibles |
| Licensing partnerships | Real clubs, leagues, players (accelerator, not dependency) |
| Live events | Pop-up arenas, fan zones, tournament venues |

Purpose: transform from a game company into a football gaming ecosystem.

### Revenue Scenario Ranges (Annual, at Maturity)

These are not projections. They are scenario ranges tied to measurable milestones.

| Scenario | Annual Revenue | What Must Be True |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Solid niche** | $5M–$30M | Good game, modest community, primarily box + digital sales |
| **Breakout tabletop + digital** | $50M–$200M | Strong retention, creator adoption, active ladder, recurring digital |
| **Global ecosystem** | $300M–$1B+ | Canonical standard, massive online ladder, cards/UGC flywheel, licensing |

The difference between scenarios is almost entirely determined by: (a) standardization, (b) network effects, (c) repeat purchasing mechanisms (cards), and (d) creator/spectator viability.

---

## 7. Competitive Moat

Taka's moat is not the idea. Any game can be copied on paper. The moat is built through:

| Moat Layer | How It's Built |
|------------|----------------|
| **Canonical ruleset** | Tournament standard, recognized by community as "the" game |
| **Network effects** | Ladder, matchmaking, friends, clubs — each new user makes the platform more valuable |
| **Content flywheel** | Openings, puzzles, analysis, creator formats — derived from play data |
| **Community legitimacy** | The hardest thing to replicate — years of tournaments, culture, and recognition |
| **Data and meta** | Online play generates analyzable patterns that fuel content and coaching tools |

If the ruleset is merely "pretty good," it is cloneable. The moat depends on being first to standardize and achieving community lock-in.

---

## 8. Expansion Vectors

### A. Team-Building Cards (Match Attax Model)

**Why it's strategic:** Cards create repeat purchases, identity ("my team"), and social trading. Match Attax proves the football card format works globally.

**Approach:** Start with unlicensed archetype cards (Pressing 9, Inverted Fullback, Set-Piece Specialist, Ball-Playing CB). Players build teams with different abilities. Seasonal balance updates keep the meta fresh.

**Licensing:** Real-player/club cards require league and player image rights — expensive and complex. Pursue licensing only after proven demand and unit economics. Licensing is an accelerant, not a prerequisite.

### B. Custom Teams and Club Partnerships

**Consumer side:** Players build and customize their own teams with cards/archetypes. Identity and progression drive retention.

**Club side:** Real clubs partner for branded content, co-hosted tournaments, and licensed products. This is a Phase 3+ opportunity — pursue selectively after the consumer game has product-market fit.

### C. Stadium Playsets and Premium Physical

Mini stadiums of real clubs where you play the game. Premium collectibles and desk artifacts. These work as limited drops once demand is proven — high-margin, giftable, brand-building. Not a core growth pillar.

### D. Advanced Game Modes

Over time, Taka can introduce additional modes that increase engagement without destabilizing the competitive core:

- Rapid format (shorter time controls)
- Best-of-3 series
- "First goal wins" speed mode
- Campaign/manager progression mode
- UGC scenario creation and sharing

The principle: one canonical competitive format stays stable. Variants and modes are additive, not replacements.

### E. Education and Schools

A competitive, zero-luck, football-themed strategy game has a natural fit in:

- After-school programs (chess-club analog)
- Academy decision-making pedagogy
- Coaching education modules

This is a steady distribution channel, not a viral one. It builds institutional adoption over time.

### F. Live Experiences

Pop-up "Taka arenas" at fan zones, tournaments, club stores, and football events. Works best when the community is large enough to generate attendance. Can become a major marketing channel and premium revenue stream.

### G. Fantasy/Meta Game Layer

A persistent "build your club" progression system without gambling — capturing the retention mechanics of fantasy sports within Taka's competitive framework.

## 9. Key Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Design risk** — game isn't deep enough or onboarding is too complex | Medium | Fatal | Rules are locked and playtested. Interactive tutorial built. Continuous refinement based on play data. |
| **Cold start** — multiplayer queue feels empty, early users churn | High (early) | High | Scheduled density (fixed weekly events), cohort onboarding (teams/clubs), bots for backfill |
| **Distribution/CAC** — paid acquisition is expensive for niche games | Medium | High | Creator-first GTM; tournament-driven growth; DTC focus; avoid broad paid ads early |
| **Positioning risk** — "for all ages" dilutes messaging | Medium | Medium | Tight wedge audience first (tactics enthusiasts, competitive gamers); expand after PMF |
| **Scope creep** — cards/licensing/modes distract from core loop | Medium | High | Strict phase gates; each expansion requires proof from the previous stage |
| **Community formation** — without ranked play and events, people churn after novelty | High (if unaddressed) | High | Seasons, tournaments, puzzles, clubs — retention systems built into the product from launch |
| **Licensing distraction** — pursuing club deals too early | Low (if disciplined) | Medium | Unlicensed archetypes first; license only after proven demand and margins |

---

## 10. What Must Be True for "Massive" to Happen

Taka's ceiling is genuinely high, but reaching it requires all of the following:

1. **Elegant core loop** — rules teachable in 5–10 minutes; mastery takes years
2. **Skill expression that feels like football** — players feel "I outthought you" in a way that maps to real football concepts
3. **High replayability and evolving meta** — openings, midgames, endgames; a competitive meta that develops over time
4. **Online ladder and content ecosystem** — ranked play, creator-friendly spectating, shareable moments
5. **Community standardization** — one recognized ruleset; network effects from a single canonical game
6. **Repeat purchasing mechanism** — cards, seasons, drops create ongoing revenue beyond box sales
7. **Spectator clarity** — non-players can follow a match quickly and understand what happened

If any of these are weak, Taka likely caps at the "solid niche" scenario. If all are strong, the ecosystem outcome becomes plausible.

---

## 12. Summary

Taka is a competitive tactics game that distills football decision-making into a fast, deep, skill-based contest. It starts as a board game — physical and online — and grows into a competitive ecosystem with ranked play, tournaments, content culture, team-building cards, and physical collectibles.

The market is large enough to support a meaningful business at any scale. The "chess of football" ambition is structurally plausible but demands exceptional execution on product, community, and standardization. The plan is sequenced to validate each stage before expanding scope.

The company's success will not be determined by market size or feature count. It will be determined by one question: **do people keep playing?**
