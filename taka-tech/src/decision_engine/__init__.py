"""
Football Decision Engine

A physics-based tactical modeling system for football analysis.

Core Concepts:
- Elimination: A defender is eliminated when the ball is past them and they
  cannot reach an effective intervention point before the attacker achieves
  a more dangerous outcome.
- Defensive Attraction: Defenders are modeled as being pulled toward ball,
  goal, and key spaces using attraction-based physics.
- State Scoring: Game states are evaluated numerically based on eliminations,
  spatial advantage, and threat proximity.

This is a tactical laboratory, not a game engine.
