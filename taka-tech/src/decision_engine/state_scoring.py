"""
Game State Scoring System

At any moment, a game state can be evaluated using a composite score:
- Number of defenders eliminated
- Distance to goal
- Angle to goal
- Density of defenders near the ball
- Compactness of the defending unit
- Availability of forward actions (pass, dribble, shot)

This score allows:
- Objective comparison of positions
- Ranking ball locations or actions
- Identification of optimal zones for progression or shooting
