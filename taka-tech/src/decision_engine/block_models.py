"""
Defensive Block Models

Defines how teams set up defensively at different heights:
- Low Block: Deep, compact, protect the goal
- Mid Block: Balanced, control center of pitch
- High Block: Aggressive press, trap opponents high

Each block has characteristic:
- Line heights (where defensive lines sit)
- Compactness targets (how tight the unit stays)
- Trigger distances (when to press vs hold)
- Space allowances (what areas to concede)
