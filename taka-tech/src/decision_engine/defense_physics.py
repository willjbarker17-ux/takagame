"""
Defensive Physics Model

Defensive behavior is modeled using attraction-based principles.
Defenders are pulled toward:
- Ball (primary attraction)
- Goal (protective attraction)
- Key spaces (lane coverage, zonal responsibility)
- Opponents (marking)

The result is emergent collective behavior:
- Compactness (players cluster around ball-goal axis)
- Cover shadows (blocking passing lanes)
- Shifting as a unit (collective movement)

This framework is naturally suited for defense because defense is
reactive and space-denying, unlike attack which is about advantage creation.
